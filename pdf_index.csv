Climate Change Impacts and Risks

Observed and projected climate change impacts

Rising temperatures increase the likelihood of the threat of heatwaves across Asia, droughts in arid and semi-arid areas of floods in monsoon regions in West, Central and South Asia, South, Southeast and East Asia, and glacier melting in the Hindu Kush Himalaya region (medium confidence) {ES-Ch10; 10.3.1}

Water

By mid-21st Century, the international transboundary river basins of Amu Darya, Indus, Ganges could face severe water scarcity challenges due to climatic variability and changes acting as stress multipliers (high confidence). {ES-Ch10}

Due to global warming, Asian countries could experience an increase in drought conditions (5-20%) by the end of this century (high confidence). {ES-Ch10}

Ecosystems

Cryosphere

Observed biodiversity or habitat losses of animals or plants have been linked to climate change in some parts of Asia (high confidence). {ES-Ch10; 10.4.2.1.2}

Glacier lake outburst flood will threaten the security of the local and downstream communities in High Mountain Asia (high confidence). {TS.C.4.2}

Future climate change would cause biodiversity and habitat loss in many parts of Asia using modelling approaches (high confidence). Future climate change would reduce the suitable habitat of certain protected plants. {10.4.2.2.2}

tidal marshes, The risk of seagrass meadows, plankton community and other marine and coastal ecosystems increases with global warming, especially at 2°C temperature rise or more (high confidence). {ES-Ch10}

irreversible loss of coral

reefs,

Observed changes in climate resulted in permafrost warming and increased thaw depth in undisturbed locations, but in built up areas these transformations were exacerbated by human activities. By 2050, it is likely that 69% of fundamental human infrastructure in the Pan Arctic will be at risk (medium confidence). {10.4.6.3.7}

Food

Health

Climate change is increasing vector-borne and water-borne diseases, undernutrition, mental disorders and allergy-related illnesses in Asia by increasing hazards such as heatwaves, in combination with flooding and drought, and air pollutants, more exposure and vulnerability (high confidence). {ES-Ch10}

In addition to all-cause mortality, deaths related to circulatory, respiratory, diabetic and infectious diseases, as well as infant mortality, are increased with high temperature (high confidence). {10.4.7.1}

Increases in heavy rain and temperature will increase the risk of diarrheal diseases, dengue fever and malaria in tropical and subtropical Asia. More frequent hot days and intense heatwaves will increase heat-related deaths in Asia. {ES-Ch10}.

Increased floods and droughts, together with heat stress, will have an adverse impact on food availability and prices, resulting in increased undernourishment in South and Southeast Asia (high confidence). (TS.C.4.6)

Energy

Asian countries are experiencing a hotter summer climate, resulting in increase of energy demand for cooling at a rapid rate, together with the population growth (high confidence). Decrease in precipitation influences energy demand as well as desalination, underground water pumping and other energy-intensive methods are increasingly used for water supply (high confidence). {ES- Ch10}

Among 13 developing countries with large energy consumption in Asia, 11 are exposed to high-energy insecurity and industrial- systems risk (high confidence). {ES-Ch10; 10.4.1}

Cities and Settlements

Climate change has caused direct losses due to the damage in infrastructure, disruption in services and affected supply chains in Asia (medium confidence) and will increase risk to infrastructure as well as provide opportunities to invest in climate-resilient infrastructure and green jobs (medium confidence). {ES-Ch10}

SIXTH ASSESSMENT REPORT Working Group II – Impacts, Adaptation and Vulnerability

Figure 1: Risks and key adaptation options in select cities across Asia. Cities were chosen to ensure coverage of different sub-regions of Asia, represent different risk profiles, different city sizes (based on current population and projected growth) and reported progress on different adaptation strategies (infrastructural, institutional, ecosystem based). {Figure 10.8, full line of sight in SM10.4}

Migration

There is robust evidence, medium agreement that increased climate variability and extreme events are already driving migration and increase migration flows across Asia. Despite medium evidence, medium agreement projecting that longer-term climate change will methodological disagreement on detection and attribution of migration due to climate change, there is medium confidence that higher warming and associated changes in frequency and intensity of slow-onset events (such as drought and sea level rise) and rapid-onset events (such as cyclones and flooding) will increase involuntary displacement in the future, especially under SSP3* and SSP4 pathways. In 2019, Bangladesh, China, India and the Philippines each recorded more than 4 million disaster displacements. In Southeast and East Asia, cyclones, floods and typhoons triggered internal displacement of 9.6 million, almost 30% of total global displacements. {ES-Ch10; Box 10.2}

Adaptation Options and Barriers

Barriers

Adaptation options

There are significant barriers to climate resilient development such as fragmented, reactive governance; inadequate evidence on which actions to prioritise and how to sequence them; and finance deficits. Some Asia countries and regions offer solutions to overcome these barriers: through use of advanced technologies (in situ observation and remote sensing, a variety of new sensor technologies, citizen science, artificial intelligence and machine learning tools); regional partnerships and learning; improved forecasting capabilities; and better risk awareness (high confidence). {ES-Ch10}

Options such as climate-smart agriculture, ecosystem-based reduction and investing in urban blue-green disaster infrastructure meet and Sustainable adaptation, mitigation Development Goals simultaneously, presenting opportunities for climate resilient development pathways in Asia (high confidence). Climate risks, vulnerability and adaptation measures need to be factored into decision making across all levels of governance (high confidence). {ES-Ch10}

Fact sheet - Australasia Climate Change Impacts and Risks

Impacts from extreme events

Extreme events such as heatwaves, droughts, floods, storms and fires have caused deaths and injuries, and affected many households, communities and businesses via impacts on ecosystems, critical infrastructure, essential services, food production, the national economy, valued places and employment. {11.5.1}

Ecosystems

Human systems

Climate trends and extreme events have combined with exposure and vulnerabilities to cause major impacts for many natural systems, with some experiencing or at risk of irreversible change in Australia (very high confidence) and in New Zealand (high confidence). The Bramble Cay melomys, an endemic mammal species, became extinct due to loss of habitat associated with sea level rise and storm surges in the Torres Strait. Extensive coral bleaching events and loss of temperate kelp forests have occurred, due to ocean warming and marine heatwaves. {ES- Ch11}

Climate trends and extreme events have combined with exposure and vulnerabilities to cause major impacts for some human systems (high confidence). Socioeconomic costs arising from climate variability and change have increased. Extreme heat has led to excess deaths and increased rates of many illnesses. Droughts have caused financial and emotional stress in farm households and rural communities. Nuisance and extreme coastal rise superimposed upon high tides and storm surges. Tourism has been affected by coral bleaching, fires, poor ski seasons and receding glaciers. {ES-Ch11}

flooding have increased due to sea level

Complex risks

Ongoing warming is projected, with more hot days and fewer cold days (very high confidence). In New Zealand, ongoing glacier retreat is projected (very high confidence). Further sea level rise, ocean warming and ocean acidification are projected (very high confidence). More extreme fire weather is projected in southern and eastern Australia (high confidence) and over northern and eastern New Zealand (medium confidence). Increased drought frequency is projected for southern and eastern Australia and northern New Zealand (medium confidence). Increased heavy rainfall intensity is projected, with fewer tropical cyclones and a greater proportion of severe cyclones (medium confidence). {ES-Ch11}

Climate impacts are cascading and compounding across sectors and socioeconomic and natural systems (high confidence). Complex connections are generating new types of risks, exacerbating existing stressors and constraining adaptation options. An example is the impacts that cascade between interdependent systems and infrastructure in cities and settlements. Another example is the 2019–2020 southeast Australia wildfires. {ES-Ch11}

Key risks

Climate risks are projected to increase for a wide range of systems, sectors and communities, which are exacerbated by underlying vulnerabilities and exposures (high confidence). Nine key risks have been identified {ES-Ch11}

1. Loss and degradation of coral reefs and associated biodiversity and ecosystem service values in Australia due to ocean warming and marine heatwaves (very high confidence)

2. Loss of alpine biodiversity in Australia due to less snow (high confidence) 3. Transition or collapse of alpine ash, snowgum woodland, pencil pine and northern jarrah forests in southern Australia due to hotter and drier conditions with more fires (high confidence)

4. Loss of kelp forests in southern Australia and southeast New Zealand due to ocean warming, marine heatwaves and overgrazing by climate-driven range extensions of herbivore fish and urchins (high confidence)

5. Loss of natural and human systems in low-lying coastal areas due to sea level rise (high confidence) 6. Disruption and decline in agricultural production and increased stress in rural communities in southwestern, southern and eastern mainland Australia due to hotter and drier conditions (high confidence) Increase in heat-related mortality and morbidity for people and wildlife in Australia due to heatwaves (high confidence)

7. 8. Cascading, compounding and aggregate impacts on cities, settlements, infrastructure, supply chains and services due to wildfires, floods, droughts, heatwaves, storms and sea level rise (high confidence) Inability of institutions and governance systems to manage climate risks (high confidence).

Adaptation Options and Barriers

Adaptation barriers

Adaptation options

The ambition, scope and progress of the adaptation process have increased across governments, non- government and communities (high confidence). {ES-Ch11}

organisations,

businesses

However, adaptation progress is uneven, due to gaps, barriers and limits to adaptation and adaptive capacity deficits (very high confidence). Barriers include lack of consistent policy direction, competing objectives, divergent risk perceptions and values, knowledge constraints, inconsistent information, fear of litigation, up-front costs and lack of engagement, trust and resources. {ES-Ch11} For ecosystems at critical thresholds (key risks 1 and 2, see above) further climate change may cause irreversible damage, with limited scope for adaptation. In some human systems, fundamental limits to adaptation include thermal thresholds and safe freshwater and the inability of some low-lying coastal communities to adapt in place (very high confidence). (ES-Ch11; 11.7.2)

A range of incremental and transformative adaptation options and pathways (Figure 1) is available as long as enablers are in place to implement them (high confidence). Responses that lock in risk by discounting ongoing and changing climate risk can create maladaptation (high confidence) and impede longterm adaptation goals (high confidence). Available tools are diversifying with futures and systems methodologies and dynamic adaptive policy pathways being increasingly used to facilitate the shift from static to dynamic adaptation by highlighting path dependencies and potential lock-in of decisions, system dependencies and the potential for cascading impacts. Adaptation decision support tools enable a shift from reactive to anticipatory planning for changing climate risks (high confidence). {ES-Ch11; 11.7.1; 11.7.3}

Key enablers for effective adaptation include shifting from reactive to anticipatory planning, integration and coordination across levels of government and sectors, inclusive and collaborative institutional arrangements, government leadership, policy alignment, nationally consistent and accessible information and decision-support tools, along with adaptation funding and finance, and robust, consistent and strategic policy commitment. A focus on the role societal inequalities and environmental degradation play in generating climate change vulnerability can enable fairer adaptation outcomes. {ES-Ch11; 11.7.3} Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Peoples and Tangata Whenua Māori can enhance effective adaptation through the passing down of knowledge about climate change planning that promotes collective action and mutual support across the region (high confidence). {ES-Ch11}

Climate Resilient Development

The projected warming under current global emissions reduction policies would leave many of the region's human and natural systems at very high risk and beyond adaptation limits (very high confidence). Delay in implementing adaptation and emission reductions will impede climate resilient development, resulting in more costly climate impacts and greater scale of adjustments. Reducing the risks would require significant and rapid emission reductions to keep global warming to 1.5-2.0°C, as well as robust and timely adaptation. {ES-Ch11}

Fact sheet - Africa

Climate Change Impacts and Risks

Africa is one of the lowest contributors to greenhouse gas emissions causing climate change, yet key development sectors have already experienced widespread losses and damages attributable to human-induced climate change, including biodiversity loss, water shortages, reduced food production, loss of lives and reduced economic growth (high confidence). Limiting global warming to 1.5°C is expected to substantially reduce damages to African economies, agriculture, human health, and ecosystems compared to higher levels of global warming (high confidence). {ES-Ch9}.

Ecosystems

Water

African biodiversity loss is projected to be widespread and escalating with every 0.5°C increase above present-day global warming (high confidence). Above 1.5°C, half of assessed species are projected to lose over 30% of their population or area of suitable habitat. At 2°C, 7–18% of terrestrial species assessed are at risk of extinction, and over 90% of east African coral reefs are projected to be destroyed by bleaching. {ES-Ch9; 9.6}

Recent extreme variability in rainfall and river discharge across Africa have had largely negative and multi-sector impacts across water-dependent sectors (high confidence). Projected changes present heightened cross-cutting risks to water-dependent sectors, and require planning under deep uncertainty for the wide range of extremes expected in future (high confidence). {ES-Ch9; 9.7}

Food

Cities and Settlements

In Africa, agricultural productivity growth has been reduced by 34% since 1961 due to climate change, more than any other region. Future warming will negatively affect food systems in Africa by shortening growing seasons and increasing water stress (high in yield confidence). Global warming above 2°C will reductions for staple crops across most of Africa compared to 2005 yields. Climate change poses a significant threat to African marine and freshwater fisheries (high confidence). Under 1.7°C global warming, reduced fish harvests could leave 1.2–70 million people in Africa vulnerable to iron deficiencies, up to 188 million for vitamin A deficiencies, and 285 million for vitamin B12 and omega-3 fatty acids by mid-century. {ES-Ch9; 9.4; 9.8}

result

Exposure of people, assets and infrastructure to climate hazards is urbanisation, compounded increasing infrastructure deficit, and growing population in informal settlements (high confidence). High population growth and urbanisation in low- elevation coastal zones will be a major driver of exposure to sea level rise in the next 50 years (high confidence). By 2030, 108–116 million people in Africa will be exposed to sea level rise (compared increasing to 190–245 million by 2060 to 54 million in 2000), relatively low population growth (medium confidence). Under scenarios, the sensitive populations (people under 5 or over 64 years old) exposed to heat waves of at least 15 days above 42 in African cities is projected to increase from around 27 million in 2010 global warming and 440 million for to 360 million by 2100 for 1.8 >4

Economy

Climate change has reduced economic growth across Africa, increasing income inequality between African countries and those in temperate northern hemisphere climates (high confidence). Across nearly all African countries, gross domestic product (GDP) per capita is projected to be at least 5% higher by 2050 and 10– 20% higher by 2100 if global warming is held to 1.5°C compared to 2°C. {ES-Ch9; 9.6; 9.11}

Heritage

Figure 1: Risks increase with increasing levels of global warming, as shown by this Burning Embers figure for selected key risks from climate change in Africa. Increase in risks are assessed for the levels of global warming above pre-industrial (1850–1900). All three risks are assessed to have already transitioned to moderate risk by the recent level of global warming 2010–2020 (1.09°C), and are expected to complete the transition to high risk before 2°C. {Figure 9.6; Table SM 9.1}

African cultural heritage is already at risk from climate hazards, including sea level rise and coastal erosion. Most African heritage sites are neither prepared for, nor adapted to, future climate change (high confidence). {ES-Ch9; 9.12}

Health

Migration

Mortality and morbidity will escalate with further global warming, placing additional strain on health and economic systems (high confidence). Above 2°C of global warming, distribution and seasonal transmission of vector-borne diseases is expected to increase, exposing tens of millions more people, mostly in west, east and southern Africa (high confidence). Above 1.5°C risk of heat-related deaths rises sharply (medium confidence), with at least 15 additional deaths per 100,000 annually across large parts of Africa. {ES-Ch9; 9.10}

Most climate-related migration observed currently is within countries or between neighbouring countries (high confidence). Over 2.6 million and 3.4 million new weather-related displacements occurred in sub-Saharan Africa in 2018 and 2019. Climate change is projected to increase migration (high agreement, medium evidence). With 1.7°C global warming by 2050, 17–40 million people could migrate internally in sub- Saharan Africa, increasing to 56–86 million for 2.5°C (>60% in west Africa). {ES-Ch9; Box 9.8}

Adaptation Options and Barriers

Barriers

Technological, barriers to climate adaptation feasibility in Africa (high confidence). Adaptation generally is cost-effective, but annual finance flows targeting adaptation for Africa are billions of US dollars less than the lowest adaptation cost estimates for near-term climate change (high confidence). {ES-Ch9; 9.3; 9.4}

institutional and financing factors are major

Climate-related research in Africa faces severe data constraints, as well as inequities in funding and research leadership that reduces adaptive capacity (very high confidence). From 1990– 2019, research on Africa received just 3.8% of climate-related research funding globally. {ES-Ch9; 9.1}

Adaptation options

Adaptation costs will rise rapidly with global warming (very high confidence). Increasing public and private finance flows by billions of dollars per year, increasing direct access to multilateral funds, strengthening project pipeline development and shifting more finance to project implementation would help realise transformative adaptation in Africa (high confidence). Concessional finance will be required for adaptation in low-income settings (high confidence). {ES-Ch9; 9.4}

Innovative index-based insurance schemes can help transfer risk and aid recovery, including in food systems (medium confidence). {ES-Ch9; 9.8; 9.11}

Agricultural and livelihood diversification, agroecological and conservation on-farm engineering and agroforestry can increase resilience and sustainability of food systems in Africa under climate change (medium confidence). {ES-Ch9; 9.8}

Integrating climate adaptation into social protection programmes, such as cash transfers, public works programmes and healthcare access, can increase resilience to climate change (high confidence). {ES-Ch9; 9.10; 9.11}

Gender-sensitive and equity-based adaptation approaches reduce vulnerability for marginalised groups across multiple sectors in Africa, including water, health, food systems and livelihoods (high confidence). {ES-Ch9; Box 9.1}

Early warning systems based on targeted climate services can be effective for disaster risk reduction, social protection programmes, and managing risks to health and food systems (high confidence). {ES-Ch9; 9.4}

Ecosystem-based adaptation can reduce climate risk while providing social, economic and environmental benefits (high confidence). Maintaining indigenous forest benefits biodiversity and reduces greenhouse gas emissions, but afforestation can harm water security and biodiversity. {ES-Ch9; 9.6; Box 9.3}

The diversity of African Indigenous knowledge and local knowledge systems provide a rich foundation for adaptation actions at local scales (high confidence). {ES-Ch9; 9.4; Box 9.1; Box 9.2}

Climate Resilient Development

Governance for climate resilient development includes long-term transboundary planning, cooperation and benefit-sharing, development pathways that increase adaptation and mitigation and reduce inequality, and implementation of Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) (high confidence). Robust facilitate effective design and implementation of climate change response options (high confidence). {ES-Ch9; 9.4}
