As a result, 127 key risks have been found across regions and sectors. These are integrated as eight overarching risks (called Representative Key Risks, RKRs) which relate to low-lying coastal systems; terrestrial and ocean ecosystems; critical physical infrastructure, networks and services; living standards and equity; human health; food security; water security; and peace and migration. Risks are projected to become severe with increased warming and under ecological or societal conditions of high exposure and vulnerability. The intertwined issues of biodiversity loss and climatic change together with human demographic changes, particularly rapid growth in low- income countries, an ageing population in high-income countries and rapid urbanisation are seen as core issues in understanding risk distribution at all scales. {16.5.2, Table 16.A.4, SMTS.2}'),\n",
