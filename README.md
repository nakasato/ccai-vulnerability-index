# Hello! ðŸ‘‹
### Welcome to our climate vulnerability project!

You can see this repo live at https://ccai-vulnerability-index.streamlit.app/

We're a team of 3 working at the CCAI Summer School 2024 at the Mila Institute in MontrÃ©al, Canada. 

With this project, we're aiming to help bridge the gap between scientists and decision makers by making data accessible and legible. 

We are: FlÃ¡vio Nakasato, Donna Slyneck, and Isabel Drummond.

ðŸŒ± Credits due:
- Index and data sourced from ND GAIN
- Myriad of policy papers
- The opportunity CCAI offered us to work together and our many mentors <3
